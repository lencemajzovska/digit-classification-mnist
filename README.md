# Digit Classification with Machine Learning

Educational machine learning project created as part of my Data Science studies. The project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset and compares multiple models to identify the best-performing approach.

## Project Description

This project includes both the development and evaluation of machine learning models for handwritten digit classification, as well as deployment of the best-performing model in an interactive Streamlit web application.

Three different models were evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extra Trees. After hyperparameter tuning, the Extra Trees model demonstrated the best performance and was deployed in a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees (final selected model)

---

## Technologies and Libraries

- Scikit-learn
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Streamlit for interactive web deployment

---

## Features of the Streamlit App

- Draw handwritten digits directly in the browser
- Real-time model predictions
- Visualization of model confidence
