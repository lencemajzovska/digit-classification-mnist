# Digit Classification with Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using machine learning. It is based on the MNIST dataset and compares three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Extra Trees. The best-performing model (Extra Trees) is implemented in an interactive Streamlit application for real-time predictions.

## 🧠 Models used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Extra Trees (selected as the best model)

## 📦 Technologies and libraries
- Scikit-learn
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Streamlit for the user interface

## 🎯 Features of the Streamlit app
- Draw a digit directly in the browser
- Get real-time predictions
- Probability visualization


## 🚀 Run the Streamlit app
```bash
streamlit run streamlit/streamlit_app.py
```
